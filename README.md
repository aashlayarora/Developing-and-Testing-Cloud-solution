•Designing, developing and testing a cloud solution.•Loading data from a configuration file to compute one or more allocations of taskssuch that the amount of energy consumed is valid and is the lowest that you can achieve. Note, there might be more than one allocation where the consumed energy is the same and the lowest.•Optimisation techniques.•Computing and displaying the amount of energy consumed by these allocations. •Displaying these allocations. •Ensuring that these new allocations are valid
